The Ultra Sonic Senor is mounted on the glasses so that it points in the forward
direction. The Piezo is mounted on the Breadboard Mini. The Ultra Sonic
Sensor measures the distance and this is done in real time. The person when in
contact with any object i.e. between 31 and 61 cm of him/her, the piezo makes a
noise of frequency of 1000 Hz and duration 50. But as soon as the distance
decreases to less than 30 cm there is a constant noise of 1000 Hz and the person
is thus alerted. This whole circuit is mounted on the glasses and can be very
helpful for the blind and people with low vision.
